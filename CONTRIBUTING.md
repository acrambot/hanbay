# Contributing to HireDjango

Welcome to [HireDjango](https://hiredjango.io)! I'm Dom, the founder, and I'd love for you to contribute to the project.

Some developers first open source contribution was to HireDjango. Let me help you make it yours, too.

## What to work on?

[Unassigned issues labelled "help wanted"](https://github.com/vacchiano/HireDjango/issues) are ready to be worked on. Comment on one to "claim" it – I'll assign it to you to let others know.

To keep things moving, you'll have 2 weeks to submit a pull request. If you don't finish in time, no worries! Comment and let me know and we can work something out.

## Need help?

First PR ever? Need help deciding which design pattern to use? Let me know – I'm more than happy to help.

Also [this guide](https://mattstauffer.com/blog/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-github-project-using-your-own-fork/) is a great resource for a basic workflow.

### Basic workfow:

1. Fork the repo
2. git clone the forked repo to your local machine
3. Create new branch to work on
4. *Work on changes in code*
5. git add, commit + git push origin -u 'your_branch_name'
6. From Github create pull request from forked repo to this project
7. Comment on the issue to notify me and I will review + respond when I get a chance.
8. [Synce your local fork with the main project](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sync-your-fork-with-master-in-github/)
